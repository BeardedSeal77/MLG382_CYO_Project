*PROCESS*
src\DataPrep\DataLoad
Splits composite `InventoryID` into StoreID, Location, ItemID
Processed the dataset if Process = True
Downloads the dataset if download = True
Creates processed files for StoreID "1" and "2"
Orders all dataframes to the same columns
saves Data\Processed\ csv files

loads the processed data.
generates lead time and sales forecast data
adding fields that help smooth the data

*PROCESS*
not sure where waldo did this
data treatment
outlier treatment
This the input data is retrieved from the Data\Prepped folder,
then outlier treatment (winsorize) is applied to the salesQuantity feature form the sales_forecast_data.csv.
 The winsorize outlier treatment is also applied to the Quantity feature from the lead_time_data.csv. Outlier treatment is done in the Data_understanding.ipynb notebook. After this treatment is applied the final data is exported to the final data folder as follows:

*DATA*
Data\final
Data\final\lead_time_data.csv
Data\final\sales_forecast_data.csv

*PROCESS*
gets fed to the models.

*SALES FORECAST MODEL*
Gets the sales_forecast_data.csv form the Data/final and uses that for the model training.

*LEAD TIME MODEL*
Gets data from Data/final/lead_time_data.csv for its use in training the Lead Time model.




*WEB APP*
loads a web app from app.py
that runs a dash server.
the layout.py provides the front end.
the callback is the api layer between the website and the python backend.
data loader loads the data from csv files to start generating a Inventory Ledger.
the sales.py uses the sales model to predict the sales forecast for the following year.
the sales get added to the Inventory Ledger.
the purchases.py uses a lead time model to order stock before the stock level hits bottom line.
